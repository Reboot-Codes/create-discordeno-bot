# `create-discordeno-bot`

A quick CLI to create a Discordeno Bot.

## Work In Progress

This CLI will create a functioning Discordeno Bot. **However**, it will not add
plugins or frameworks _yet_. I wouldn't suggest using this CLI yet because of
this current limitation. But feel free to experiment; PR's are very much
welcome!

## Usage

If you're skeptical about running a script from the internet, you can `curl`
that URL, or just take a look at the source code here.

```bash
deno run --reload --unstable -A https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reboot-Codes/create-discordeno-bot/main/mod.ts
```
