# `create-discordeno-bot`

A quick CLI to create a Discordeno Bot. (WIP, **will not** create a functional DD bot.)

## Usage

If you're skeptical about running a script from the internet, you can `curl` that URL, or just take a look at the source code here.

```bash
deno run --unstable -A https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reboot-Codes/create-discordeno-bot/main/mod.ts
```
